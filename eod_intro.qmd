## What is Earth observation data?

![Journey into EO data for social scientists (AI generated image).](images/EO_cats.png){ width=60% align=center }

Earth observation (EO) data refers to all collected information about the Earth's
physical, chemical, and biological systems. Utilizing Earth observation data
allows to study the Earth's atmosphere, land cover, oceans and inland waters,
as well as biological diversity and ecosystems. Applications of EO data in
academia, industry, and policy-making are extensive. It is crucial for the operation
of activities in environmental protection, energy management, urban planning, 
agriculture and fisheries, forestry, public health, transport and mobility, 
civil protection, or tourism.

  <summary>Additional information on Earth system indicators</summary>
  There are many crucial Earth system indicators. With respect to the Earth's climate, for example,
  the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) maps 55 Essential Climate Variables
  (ECVs). ECVs are seen as the empirical evidence base for the guidance of mitigation and adaptation measures, risk assessment and the understanding of climate services. 
EO data is essential for systematically measuring these variables. Check
  out their [documentation of ECVs](https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/about).

There is often confusion about terms such as Earth observation data, geodata,
remote sensing, or satellite data. Let's disentangle these different concepts.

- **Earth observation data**: Information collected about the Earth's system
- **Geospatial data**: Data that is georeferenced (includes information on the location)
- **Remote sensing data**: Information that is acquired by sensors "from a distance"
- **Satellite data**: Information that is acquired by sensors via satellites.

As you can see, these four terminologies address different aspects of the data.
While "EO data" refers to the content of the data (the Earth system), "geospatial
data" addresses the location, and "remote sensing" and "satellite data" address
the way of obtaining the data.

The Venn diagram below visualizes these definitions and shows overlaps and gaps between
these concepts. Except for satellite data, which can be seen as a subset of
remote sensing data, all other concepts have overlaps and gaps with each other.

Let's disentangle these overlaps a bit further:

- **A**: The area **A** captures all concepts discussed above - Georeferenced 
Earth observation data derived from satellite data (and thus remote sensing). 
An example for this are nighttime lights. The sentinel satellite... [insert example and link].
- **B**: Area **B** is similar to **A** except that this data is derived from
remote sensing OTHER than satellite data. There are, in fact, other sources of
sensors from aircrafts or drones.
Data on gases in the atmosphere are collected that way - an example would be... [insert]
- **C**: **C** represents EO data which is georeferenced but NOT derived from
remote sensing. There are several alternatives to EO data generation: When it comes
to sensor-based data collection, ground-based sensors (called "in-situ") which
collect data locally are common sources of EO data. Weather stations are common
examples. But **C** also captures a data source which is very familiar to social
scientists: Field surveys and survey-based methods. This work is not just performed by
experts. Think about citizen science projects: Scientists work together with 
"laypeople" to map bird populations [link], the quality of rivers [link], or XXX.
- **D** and **E**: The two areas **D** and **E** deviate from the previous areas
because they are NOT EO data. **D** captures all geodata which is not derived from
remote sensing and does not constitute EO data. This is primarily data which is
human-centered - many examples of which are familiar to social scientists:
Georeferenced variables on socio-demographics or economic indicators like Census
data [link], electoral outcomes [link], or environmental attitudes and behavior [link].
**E** represents a special case of such data derived from remote sensing. Examples
could be XY.

As you can see, the main areas when it comes to EO data are **A**, **B**, and **C**.
As social scientists interested in working with EO data, **D** and **E** are similarly
relevant: Often, we are interested in spatially linking our social indicators (**D**)
with EO data. We therefore see these as two sides of the same coin. The geolocation
represents the link.

Be aware that there are a few additional areas in the Venn diagram which we have
not highlighted. These are the fields which do not overlap with the circle for
"geodata". There are some examples for non-georeferenced EO data or remote 
sensing data like X, Y, Z. Since we are focussing on geo-referenced data in this
project, these part will not be further considered in our tutorials.

It should be noted that in practice, common indicators are integrated from various
sensors or data collection types to increase data quality by enhancing accuracy, 
scope and resolution, to validate data, or to fill data gaps. 
We will explore a few common sources and indicators in the next chapter.

## Applications in the social sciences

A growing interest in economics and the social sciences in earth observation data 
has led to a broad thematic spectrum of publications in recent years. 
They range from studying environmental attitudes and behavior, 
economic development, the role of climate change for violent conflicts and 
causes of flight, and electoral behavior. 

Articles include [@hoffmann_climate_2022; @garcia-leon_current_2021; @jean_combining_2016].

Novel applications of machine learning (ML) on satellite and aerial imagery expand
the potential of EO data for the construction of new indicators. Stanford's 
[DeepSolar](https://deepsolar.web.app/), for example, maps solar PV installations.

## Relevant sources of Earth observation data

![Where do we get EO data? (AI generated image)](images/cat_api.png){ width=60% align=center }

Europe's Earth Observation programme is called [Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/en).
It is funded and managed by the European Commission and partners like the 
[European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) (ESA) and the 
[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites](https://www.eumetsat.int/) (EUMETSAT). 
It has been operational since 2014 and provides free access to a wealth of 
satellite data from ESA's “Sentinel” fleet. Copernicus combines data from satellites, 
ground-based as well as air- and sea-borne sensors to track the Earth system and 
provide this information largely free for all customers.

The ESA describes Copernicus as the world's most ambitious Earth observation 
program, which will be further expanded in the coming years. On the [Copernicus homepage](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data.), the daily data collection 
is estimated at 12 terabytes. Given the complexity of issues, Copernicus has 
separated its services for public usage along several thematic areas:

- **Atmosphere**: [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/) (CAMS)
- **Marine**: [Copernicus Marine Service](https://marine.copernicus.eu/) (CMEMS)
- **Land**: [Copernicus Land Monitoring Service](https://land.copernicus.eu/en) (CLMS)
- **Climate change**: [Copernicus Climate Change Service](https://climate.copernicus.eu/) (C3S)
- **Emergency**: [Copernicus Emergency Management Service](https://emergency.copernicus.eu/) (CEMS).

This project focuses on the data provided by the Copernicus programme. However,
this is not the only relevant source of EO data which you can consider for your
projects. The US equivalent, for example, is based on the [Landsat satellite programme](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/), 
which is jointly operated by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) and the 
[US Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions) (USGS). [Google's Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog)
catalogs an extensive selection of additional data sets from various sources.

## Data quality

Data quality

The German Federal Statistical Office (DESTATIS) is currently evaluating the
usage of remote sensing data for official statistical accounts in several projects
as part of their [experimental statistics](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/EXSTAT/_node.html).

- [Smart business cycle statistics based on satellite data](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/EXSTAT/Datensaetze/satellite-data.html)
- [Remote sensing data and artifical intelligence in the register census](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/EXSTAT/Datensaetze/register-census.html)
- [Satellite-based early estimate of short-term economic development](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/EXSTAT/Datensaetze/satellite-based-early-estimate.html)
