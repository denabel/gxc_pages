## Accessed datasets

This page summarizes the supported catalogue of indicators. The current version
accesses datasets from:

**1. Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)**:  

- [ERA5-Land Monthly Averaged Data (1950–Present)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means?tab=overview)
- [ERA5 Monthly Averaged Data on Single Levels (1940–Present)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means?tab=overview)

## Dataset Attributes

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)

# Create dataset attributes table
dataset_attributes <- data.frame(
  Attribute = c("Projection", "Spatial Resolution", "Spatial Coverage (Extent)", "Temporal Resolution", "Temporal Coverage", "Update Frequency"),
  `ERA5-Land Monthly Averaged Data` = c("WGS84 (EPSG:4326)", "~9 km (~0.1°)", "Global (-90° to 90°, -180° to 180°)", "Monthly", "1950 to present", "Monthly"),
  `ERA5 Monthly Averaged Data on Single Levels` = c("WGS84 (EPSG:4326)", "~31 km (~0.25°)", "Global (-90° to 90°, -180° to 180°)", "Monthly", "1940 to present", "Monthly")
)
