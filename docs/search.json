    "text": "Welcome to the project website of “GESIS meets Copernicus” (GxC).\n\n\nFor many researchers in the social sciences, Earth observation (EO) data represents a black box. Social science researchers face many obstacles in applying and using these data, resulting from 1) a lack of technical expertise, 2) a lack of knowledge of data sources and how to access them, 3) unfamiliarity with complex data formats, such as high-resolution, longitudinal raster datacubes, and 4) a lack of expertise in integrating the data into existing social science datasets. GxC aims to close the gap by creating an automated interface to EO data and complementary resources for social science research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project’s core is creating an open-source tool to link time- and space-sensitive social science datasets with data from Earth observation programs. Detailed documentation and beginner-friendly tutorials complement the tool to showcase the capability of our project. The social science community is the main target group of our tool. At the same time, Earth system science researchers may similarly profit from integrated social science data. This project supports inter- and transdisciplinary research which is often made difficult because of technical, disciplinary, and organizational barriers. The project emphasizes research data management (RDM) workflows based on FAIR Data and Open Science principles. All code is written in the open-source software R and is made available on this website.\nBelow, you will find more information about navigation on this page."

    "text": "The unique feature of the tool should be the possibility of carrying out both geographically and temporally high-resolution queries of data from Copernicus and other Earth observation data sources, which at the same time function efficiently on simple workstations albeit large amounts of data. Our tested workflow development has identified five major levers: indicator type, indicator intensity, focal time period, baseline time period, and spatial buffer. Flexibility on these five attributes should be maximized for users. The tool also offers the functionality to automatically derive spatio-temporal links with other georeferenced data (e.g., surveys, digital behavioral data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers should benefit from the core variables integrated into the interface for social research. Preparatory work is currently being carried out to select appropriate indicators from the corpus of indicators offered by data providers and conceptualize the data integration logic. Furthermore, in exchange with users and other stakeholders, we compile data products from EOD that are particularly relevant for social scientists. Examples include data on local air quality and pollutants, extreme weather events, or land use changes. The main data providers will be the Copernicus Monitoring Services on Climate Change, Atmosphere, and Land.\n\n\n\nMajor attributes for indicator specification. Source: Abel and Jünger 2024\n\n\nGESIS strongly supports the FAIR data principles and Open Data. The selection of R as the programming language for the tool supports open-source infrastructure development and shareability, as well as quality control via online repositories. Publishing the R scripts for data management and analysis ensures the reproducibility of all research steps."

    "text": "Journey into EO data for social scientists (AI generated image).\n\n\nEarth observation (EO) data refers to all collected information about the Earth’s physical, chemical, and biological systems. Utilizing Earth observation data allows to study the Earth’s atmosphere, land cover, oceans and inland waters, as well as biological diversity and ecosystems. Applications of EO data in academia, industry, and policy-making are extensive. It is crucial for the operation of activities in environmental protection, energy management, urban planning, agriculture and fisheries, forestry, public health, transport and mobility, civil protection, or tourism.\n\n\nAdditional information on Earth system indicators\n\nThere are many crucial Earth system indicators. With respect to the Earth’s climate, for example, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) maps 55 Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). ECVs are seen as the empirical evidence base for the guidance of mitigation and adaptation measures, risk assessment and the understanding of climate services. EO data is essential for systematically measuring these variables. Check out their documentation of ECVs.\n\n\n\nECVs as proposed by GCOS. Source: GCOS 2024 (https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/)\n\n\n\nThere is often confusion about terms such as Earth observation data, geodata, remote sensing, or satellite data. Let’s disentangle these different concepts.\n\nEarth observation data: Information collected about the Earth’s system\nGeospatial data: Data that is georeferenced (includes information on the location)\nRemote sensing data: Information that is acquired by sensors “from a distance”\nSatellite data: Information that is acquired by sensors via satellites.\n\nAs you can see, these four terminologies address different aspects of the data. While “EO data” refers to the content of the data (the Earth system), “geospatial data” addresses the location, and “remote sensing” and “satellite data” address the way of obtaining the data.\nThe Venn diagram below visualizes these definitions and shows overlaps and gaps between these concepts.

Weather stations are common examples. But C also captures a data source which is very familiar to social scientists: Field surveys and survey-based methods. This work is not just performed by experts. Think about citizen science projects: Scientists work together with “laypeople” to map bird populations [link], the quality of rivers [link], or XXX.\nD and E: The two areas D and E deviate from the previous areas because they are NOT EO data. D captures all geodata which is not derived from remote sensing and does not constitute EO data.

E represents a special case of such data derived from remote sensing. Examples could be XY.\n\nAs you can see, the main areas when it comes to EO data are A, B, and C. As social scientists interested in working with EO data, D and E are similarly relevant: Often, we are interested in spatially linking our social indicators (D) with EO data. We therefore see these as two sides of the same coin. The geolocation represents the link.\nBe aware that there are a few additional areas in the Venn diagram which we have not highlighted. These are the fields which do not overlap with the circle for “geodata”. There are some examples for non-georeferenced EO data or remote sensing data like X, Y, Z. Since we are focussing on geo-referenced data in this project, these part will not be further considered in our tutorials.\nIt should be noted that in practice, common indicators are integrated from various sensors or data collection types to increase data quality by enhancing accuracy, scope and resolution, to validate data, or to fill data gaps. We will explore a few common sources and indicators in the next chapter."

It is funded and managed by the European Commission and partners like the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). It has been operational since 2014 and provides free access to a wealth of satellite data from ESA’s “Sentinel” fleet. Copernicus combines data from satellites, ground-based as well as air- and sea-borne sensors to track the Earth system and provide this information largely free for all customers.\n\n\nAdditional information on the Copernicus programme\n\nCheck out this 5min video on the Copernicus programme.\n\nThe ESA describes Copernicus as the world’s most ambitious Earth observation program, which will be further expanded in the coming years. On the Copernicus homepage, the daily data collection is estimated at 12 terabytes. Given the complexity of issues, Copernicus has separated its services for public usage along several thematic areas:\n\nAtmosphere: Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)\nMarine: Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS)\nLand: Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS)\nClimate change: Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)\nEmergency: Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS).\n\n\n\n\nCopernicus infrastructure and data services. Source: https://www.copernicus.eu/en/accessing-data-where-and-how/conventional-data-access-hubs\n\n\nThis project focuses on the data provided by the Copernicus programme. However, this is not the only relevant source of EO data which you can consider for your projects. The US equivalent, for example, is based on the Landsat satellite programme, which is jointly operated by NASA and the US Geological Survey (USGS). Google’s Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform catalogs an extensive selection of additional data sets from various sources."

    "text": "The unique feature of the tool should be the possibility of carrying out both geographically and temporally high-resolution queries of data from Copernicus and other Earth observation data sources, which at the same time function efficiently on simple workstations albeit large amounts of data. Our tested workflow development has identified five major levers: indicator type, indicator intensity, focal time period, baseline time period, and spatial buffer. Flexibility on these five attributes should be maximized for users. The tool also offers the functionality to automatically derive spatio-temporal links with other georeferenced data (e.g., surveys, digital behavioral data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers should benefit from the core variables integrated into the interface for social research. Preparatory work is currently being carried out to select appropriate indicators from the corpus of indicators offered by data providers and conceptualize the data integration logic. Furthermore, in exchange with users and other stakeholders, we compile data products from EOD that are particularly relevant for social scientists. Examples include data on local air quality and pollutants, extreme weather events, or land use changes. The main data providers will be the Copernicus Monitoring Services on Climate Change, Atmosphere, and Land.\n\n\n\nMajor attributes for indicator specification. Source: Abel and Jünger 2024\n\n\nGESIS strongly supports the FAIR data principles and Open Data. The selection of R as the programming language for the tool supports open-source infrastructure development and shareability, as well as quality control via online repositories. Publishing the R scripts for data management and analysis ensures the reproducibility of all research steps."
