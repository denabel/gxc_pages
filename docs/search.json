    "text": "The unique feature of the tool should be the possibility of carrying out both geographically and temporally high-resolution queries of data from Copernicus and other Earth observation data sources, which at the same time function efficiently on simple workstations albeit large amounts of data. Our tested workflow development has identified five major levers: indicator type, indicator intensity, focal time period, baseline time period, and spatial buffer. Flexibility on these five attributes should be maximized for users. The tool also offers the functionality to automatically derive spatio-temporal links with other georeferenced data (e.g., surveys, digital behavioral data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers should benefit from the core variables integrated into the interface for social research. Preparatory work is currently being carried out to select appropriate indicators from the corpus of indicators offered by data providers and conceptualize the data integration logic. Furthermore, in exchange with users and other stakeholders, we compile data products from EOD that are particularly relevant for social scientists. Examples include data on local air quality and pollutants, extreme weather events, or land use changes. The main data providers will be the Copernicus Monitoring Services on Climate Change, Atmosphere, and Land.\n\n\n\nMajor attributes for indicator specification. Source: Abel and Jünger 2024\n\n\nGESIS strongly supports the FAIR data principles and Open Data. The selection of R as the programming language for the tool supports open-source infrastructure development and shareability, as well as quality control via online repositories. Publishing the R scripts for data management and analysis ensures the reproducibility of all research steps."

    "text": "Journey into EO data for social scientists (AI generated image).\n\n\nEarth observation (EO) data refers to all collected information about the Earth’s physical, chemical, and biological systems. Utilizing Earth observation data allows to study the Earth’s atmosphere, land cover, oceans and inland waters, as well as biological diversity and ecosystems. Applications of EO data in academia, industry, and policy-making are extensive. It is crucial for the operation of activities in environmental protection, energy management, urban planning, agriculture and fisheries, forestry, public health, transport and mobility, civil protection, or tourism.\n\n\nAdditional information on Earth system indicators\n\nThere are many crucial Earth system indicators. With respect to the Earth’s climate, for example, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) maps 55 Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). ECVs are seen as the empirical evidence base for the guidance of mitigation and adaptation measures, risk assessment and the understanding of climate services. EO data is essential for systematically measuring these variables. Check out their documentation of ECVs.\n\n\n\nECVs as proposed by GCOS. Source: GCOS 2024 (https://gcos.wmo.int/en/essential-climate-variables/)\n\n\n\nThere is often confusion about terms such as Earth observation data, geodata, remote sensing, or satellite data. Let’s disentangle these different concepts.\n\nEarth observation data 🌎: Information collected about the Earth’s system\nGeospatial data 🗺: Data that is georeferenced (includes information on the location)\nRemote sensing data 📡: Information that is acquired by sensors “from a distance”\nSatellite data 🛰: Information that is acquired by sensors via satellites.\n\nAs you can see, these four terminologies address different aspects of the data. While “EO data” refers to the content of the data (the Earth system), “geospatial data” addresses the location, and “remote sensing” and “satellite data” address the way of obtaining the data.\nThe Venn diagram below visualizes these definitions and shows overlaps and gaps between these concepts. Except for satellite data, which can be seen as a subset of remote sensing data, all other concepts have overlaps and gaps with each other.\n\n\n\nEO Venn diagram. Source: Abel and Jünger 2024\n\n\nLet’s disentangle these overlaps a bit further:\n\nA: The area A captures all concepts discussed above - Georeferenced Earth observation data derived from satellite sensors. An example for this are nighttime lights 🌃. Night lights are highly informative for social scientists to measure population growth, electrification and light pollution, the expansion of urban areas, the impacts of natural events, and economic activity. An important satellite for nighttime lights is the NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP), which was launched in 2011. On board of Suomi NPP, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument observes nighttime lights with the day night band (DNB). Luckily for us, we do not have to handle this raw data. NASA’s Black Marble project offers various pre-processed products with high spatial and temporal resolution and temporal coverage since 2012 based on these observations with free and open access. Even better for us is the fact that the BlackMarbleR-package offers easy access for R users.\n\nB: Area B is similar to A except that this data is derived from remote sensing OTHER than satellite data. There are, in fact, other platforms for sensors, like aircrafts or drones. For example, data on gases in the atmosphere are collected that way. For example, commercial providers offer airborne measurements of GHG emissions on a very high spatial resolution (&lt;1m) to estimate point-source emissions.\nC: C represents EO data which is georeferenced but NOT derived from remote sensing. There are several alternatives to EO data generation: When it comes to sensor-based data collection, ground-based sensors (called “in-situ”) which collect data locally are common sources of EO data. Weather stations are common examples, local air quality sensors another. Projects like Google StreetView can also be classified here. But C also captures a data source which is very familiar to social scientists: Field surveys and survey-based methods. Biodiversity monitoring and soil quality projects often employ these methods. This work is not necessarily performed by experts. Think about citizen science projects: Scientists work together with “laypeople” to map bird populations like the RSPB in the UK with the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.\nD and E: The two areas D and E deviate from the previous areas because they are NOT EO data. D captures all geodata which is not derived from remote sensing and does not constitute EO data. This is primarily data which is human-centered - many examples of which are familiar to social scientists: Georeferenced variables on socio-demographics or economic indicators like Census data, electoral outcomes, or environmental attitudes and behavior. Examples for E, data gathered based on remote sensing but is NOT classified as Earth observation, are space exploration and astronomy 🌌. Imaging of Mars’ surface is such an example. Future generations of social scientists might be concerned with interplanetary societal issues - (un)fortunately for us, we will focus on societies from planet Earth 🚀.\n\nAs you can see, the main areas when it comes to EO data are A, B, and C. As social scientists interested in working with EO data, D is similarly relevant: Often, we are interested in spatially linking our social indicators (D) with EO data. We therefore see these as two sides of the same coin. The geolocation represents the link.\nBe aware that there are a few additional areas in the Venn diagram which we have not highlighted. These are the fields which do not overlap with the circle for “geodata”. There are some examples for non-georeferenced EO data or remote sensing data [add]. Since we are focussing on geo-referenced data in this project, these parts will not be further considered in our tutorials.\nIt should be noted that in practice, common indicators are integrated from various sensors or data collection types to increase data quality by enhancing accuracy, scope and resolution, to validate data, or to fill data gaps. We will explore a few common sources and indicators in the next chapter."

It is funded and managed by the European Commission and partners like the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). It has been operational since 2014 and provides free access to a wealth of satellite data from ESA’s “Sentinel” fleet. Copernicus combines data from satellites, ground-based as well as air- and sea-borne sensors to track the Earth system and provide this information largely free for all customers.\n\n\nAdditional information on the Copernicus programme\n\nCheck out this 5min video on the Copernicus programme.\n\nThe ESA describes Copernicus as the world’s most ambitious Earth observation program, which will be further expanded in the coming years. On the Copernicus homepage, the daily data collection is estimated at 12 terabytes. Given the complexity of issues, Copernicus has separated its services for public usage along several thematic areas:\n\nAtmosphere 🏭: Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)\nMarine 🐳: Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS)\nLand 🏞: Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS)\nClimate change ❄️ 🌡: Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)\nEmergency ⛈ 🌪: Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS).\n\n\n\n\nCopernicus infrastructure and data services. Source: https://www.copernicus.eu/en/accessing-data-where-and-how/conventional-data-access-hubs\n\n\nThis project focuses on the data provided by the Copernicus programme. However, this is not the only relevant source of EO data which you can consider for your projects. The US equivalent, for example, is based on the Landsat satellite programme, which is jointly operated by NASA and the US Geological Survey (USGS). Google’s Earth Engine Cloud Computing Platform catalogs an extensive selection of additional data sets from various sources."

    "text": "The unique feature of the tool should be the possibility of carrying out both geographically and temporally high-resolution queries of data from Copernicus and other Earth observation data sources, which at the same time function efficiently on simple workstations albeit large amounts of data. Our tested workflow development has identified five major levers: indicator type, indicator intensity, focal time period, baseline time period, and spatial buffer. Flexibility on these five attributes should be maximized for users. The tool also offers the functionality to automatically derive spatio-temporal links with other georeferenced data (e.g., surveys, digital behavioral data).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers should benefit from the core variables integrated into the interface for social research. Preparatory work is currently being carried out to select appropriate indicators from the corpus of indicators offered by data providers and conceptualize the data integration logic. Furthermore, in exchange with users and other stakeholders, we compile data products from EOD that are particularly relevant for social scientists. Examples include data on local air quality and pollutants, extreme weather events, or land use changes. The main data providers will be the Copernicus Monitoring Services on Climate Change, Atmosphere, and Land.\n\n\n\nMajor attributes for indicator specification. Source: Abel and Jünger 2024\n\n\nGESIS strongly supports the FAIR data principles and Open Data. The selection of R as the programming language for the tool supports open-source infrastructure development and shareability, as well as quality control via online repositories. Publishing the R scripts for data management and analysis ensures the reproducibility of all research steps."

    "text": "The list below summarizes the most important data quality criteria for EO data:\n\nParameter type: Measuring the specific indicator of interest. This could be for example values of nighttime lights, GHG emissions like CO2 or CH4 from the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), or landscape values like NDVI.\nProjection: tba\nSpatial resolution: The spatial resolution reports the granularity of the data. Finer granularity stores more detailed information on the parameter. For gridded data, and depending on the measurement framework, the spatial resolution is either reported in angular units (degrees) that represent longitude and latitude in a spherical coordinate system or square (kilo-)meters projected into Cartesian coordinate systems. High-resolution airborne monitoring, for example, achieves a spatial resolution at or below 1x1m. Publicly available data products derived from satellite data are often much more coarse with values of 1x1km or larger, like the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC). The spatial resolution of georeferenced data which is stored in vector-format refers to the detailedness and aggregation level of data in points, lines, and polygons. For example, is pollution data stored for each individual emitting factory in point location or as regional or national averages?\nSpatial coverage: The spatial coverage (or scope) refers to the extensiveness of data across the globe. The delineation of coverage can be based on the exact spatial extent of gridded data, or on administrative units like regions and countries.\nTemporal resolution: Similar to the spatial resolution, the temporal resolution records the intervalls at which information is stored. (Near-)real-time data from public sources have hourly or daily intervals. Many datasets also provide monthly or yearly averages.\nTemporal coverage: The temporal coverage (scope) means the time period, which is covered by the dataset. Given that many remote sensing and satellite programs have emerged only recently, the temporal coverage of observational data is limited. Fortunately, reanalysis programs, simulation studies, and data fusion projects have extended the historical coverage of many EO indicators considerably. Check out, for example, the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS), which has produced annual estimates of several anthropogenic emission species over the entire industrial period from 1750!\nMeasurement type: EO data can be collected through different channels. Bottom-up approaches like direct reporting of emissions based on in-situ sensors or estimations of point sources can offer high accuracy but often lack broad coverage. In contrast, top-down approaches based on remote sensing can generate global coverage at risk of accuracy issues. Many data products integrate different data sources and apply additional techniques to increase data quality through simulation studies, data fusion, or reanalysis.\nProcessing level: The processing level describes how much pre-processing of the original raw data has been involved. Levels are often classified from 0 (raw) to 4 (model output). As endusers, we are normally accessing data products at level 2 or 3, which represent derived geophysical variables mapped on uniform space-time grid scales and checked for completeness and consistency.
