## What are datacubes?

*Data cubes*: Building on the concept of raster stacks, data cubes take this idea further by organizing raster data into a three-dimensional structure. A data cube represents multiple raster layers across spatial and temporal dimensions (and sometimes additional dimensions, such as different environmental variables). This format allows for efficient storage, processing, and analysis of large volumes of spatiotemporal data. Data cubes are particularly useful in remote sensing applications, where you may have large datasets consisting of multiple bands (e.g., satellite imagery) or data captured over time.
